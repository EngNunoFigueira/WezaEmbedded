# This script is a small bash solution, that will be used to analize       #
# or investigate the CoreMW LOG <sw> or library, in an environment machine.#

# MAIN:

# Create a file with your owne rules for Logrotate:
 touch myRotateFile && mv myRotateFile /etc/Logrotate.d/
 #content of my myRotateFile:
 /var/log/<fileToLog>/* {
    daily
    rotate 3
    size 10M
    compress
    delaycompress
    create 0600 root root
}

where:
#weekly : 
means that the tool will attempt to rotate the logs on a weekly basis. Other possible values are daily and monthly.
#rotate 3:
indicates that only 3 rotated logs should be kept. Thus, the oldest file will be removed on the fourth subsequent run.
#size=10M: 
sets the minimum size for the rotation to take place to 10M. In other words, each log will not be rotated until it reaches 10MB.
#compress and delaycompress:
 are used to tell that all rotated logs, with the exception of the most recent one, should be compressed.

 #RUNNING THE LOG ROTATE:
 Letâ€™s execute a dry-run to see what logrotate would do if it was actually executed now. 
 Use the -d option followed by the configuration file (you can actually run logrotate by omitting this option):

 $ logrotate -d /etc/logrotate.d/apache2.conf

 #ROTATION DIRECTOR:
 create a folder to save all logs came from my Cpp programming.
 this director will be the rotat place.
 mkdir /var/log/nundelLog/<........files:> nundel.log
