# WezaEmbedded
As an engineer and hobbyist, I work in different personal projects and solutions with different purposes. For example, R&D for learning new features, framework, programming languages, UNIX system tasks, tools, and working on some products I am pretending to put on the market.

FIRMWARE
Related to the firmware, I am developing solution for different microcontrollers and procesors, such as, Texas Instruments MCU Family MSP430FR,
ARM STM32, Microchip 16/32 bits.

SOFTWARE
I write C++ code using the version of 11, 14,17 just for training different features and aspect of the lenguage I used in my 9am to 17pm job. 
But you can found others software solution I developed with commercial purpose. For example, the NodeJS REST API, the Angular TaxManagement System and others...

FEATURES:
The firmware part I pretend to share is the code solution to control the followings peripherics:
DMA, ADC, DAC, UART, SPI, I2C, PWM, INT1, INT2, and other functionality associted with the GPIOs.
