Project: 
    This exercise was proposed during a C++ Test Skill Interview with Karat Software Engineer...
Description: 
    Given a vector with a list of strings, and an input string we need check if one of the words in the vector are part of the string.
Example: 
   for example, consider that the Vector is :words {"cato", "ax", "bbabythath", "maronacatdixes", "tewyolmfgax"}
Example: 
   And the string is eacrhThisString="percatomaselvi"...How we can see, one of the words of the VECTOR is "cato" and is include on the middle of the string.
Requirement: 
   Build a function that receive this two parameters and found if the input String contain any word of the vector...
My Solution: 
   First of all, the problem can be very trick... And during the interview, I try avoid develop a solution, in C++ 14
   that was implemented with BIG NOTATION n(OÂ²)... 
   In that time my idea was that if I'm developing a code for a job interview, I need give a good solution... 
   And I spend the time looking for a good solution and avoid using a two cicles <for> inside a small function...
